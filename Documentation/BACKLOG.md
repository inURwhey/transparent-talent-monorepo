## Unrefined Ideas & Brainstorming
*This section is an inbox for raw ideas. During a "Session Summary" they will be refined, scored, and moved into the prioritized backlog below.*

## AI Model Column Definition
The "AI Model" column indicates the estimated complexity and nuance required from the AI assistant (me) to generate and debug the code for a given feature. This helps in task prioritization and resource allocation for development assistance.

*   **Flash:** The task is straightforward, involves well-defined patterns, and requires minimal nuanced understanding or complex multi-step reasoning from the AI assistant to generate the code and deployment instructions. Typically involves standard CRUD operations, simple UI components, or clear logical flows.
*   **Pro:** The task is complex, requires deeper contextual understanding, nuanced code generation, advanced debugging strategies, or involves significant architectural decisions from the AI assistant's perspective. This might include optimizing complex algorithms, designing sophisticated data structures, or tackling tricky cross-service integrations.
*   **N/A:** The task is primarily conceptual, strategic, or involves manual work that does not require the AI assistant's direct code generation assistance.

### [v0.3.1] - 2025-06-28 - Failed Authentication Bugfix Attempt

This release documents a significant but unsuccessful attempt to resolve the critical production authentication bug. While the issue persists, the debugging process revealed key insights into the unexpected behavior of the `clerk-backend-api` library, which will inform the next attempt.

### Changed
-   **Iterative Debugging on `auth.py`:** Multiple versions of the `token_required` decorator were deployed to diagnose a series of cascading errors. This process invalidated several common implementation patterns.

### Fixed
-   **Clerk Dashboard Misconfiguration:** Corrected a user-facing issue where a misconfigured "Restrictions" list was improperly blocking valid user sign-in attempts.

### Unresolved Issues
-   **Critical `401 Unauthorized` Error:** The root cause of the authentication failure remains. The latest logs indicate the `clerk.authenticate_request()` method is throwing a `TypeError: Clerk.authenticate_request() missing 1 required positional argument: 'options'`, even when provided with what appear to be the correct parameters. The exact expected structure for the `options` argument remains unknown.

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-06-27 - End-to-End User Authentication

This version implements a complete, secure authentication system across the entire application stack, from the frontend client to the backend API.

### Added
-   **User Authentication:** Integrated Clerk for robust user sign-up, sign-in, and session management across the full stack.
-   **Frontend Middleware:** Added `middleware.ts` to the Next.js app to protect all routes and enforce authentication.
-   **Backend Token Validation:** Created an `auth.py` decorator in the Flask backend to validate JWTs on all protected API endpoints.
-   **Clerk SDKs:** Added `@clerk/nextjs` to the frontend and `clerk-backend-api` to the backend.
-   **Database Migration:** Added a `clerk_user_id` column to the `users` table to link application data with the authentication provider.

### Changed
-   **API Security:** All backend endpoints in `app.py` were refactored to be protected by the `@token_required` decorator and to securely derive the user's identity from the session, removing user identifiers from URL parameters.
-   **Frontend Dashboard:** The main dashboard component was refactored to use modern, secure data-loading hooks (`useAuth`, `useUser`) instead of relying on URL parameters.
-   **Frontend Layout:** Modified `apps/frontend/app/layout.tsx` to include the `<ClerkProvider>` and user session controls (`<UserButton>`).

### Fixed
-   **Vercel Deployments:** Resolved a series of `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` and TypeScript build errors by correcting the Clerk middleware implementation and component props.
-   **Render Deployments:** Fixed numerous `ModuleNotFoundError` and `TypeError` crashes by correcting the Clerk python package name (`clerk-backend-api`), updating the import paths in `auth.py`, and aligning the Clerk client usage with the specific library version's requirements.
-   **Python Versioning:** Discovered and confirmed that the original Python version (3.13) was incompatible with the authentication libraries, necessitating a downgrade to a stable LTS version (3.12) for production deployments.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-06-26 - Monorepo Migration & Production Deployment

This version marks the successful re-architecting of the project into a professional monorepo structure and the full deployment of all services to production hosting environments.

### Added
-   **`vercel.json`:** Created a Vercel configuration file to provide explicit build and routing instructions, ensuring successful deployment of the frontend application.
-   **`ARCHITECTURE.md`:** Added a dedicated document to formally describe the full-stack system architecture.

### Changed
-   **Repository Structure:** Migrated the entire codebase from two separate projects into a single monorepo, managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo.
-   **Frontend Deployment:** The Next.js frontend is now deployed to **Vercel** from the `apps/frontend` directory of the monorepo.
-   **Backend Deployment:** The Render deployment configuration was updated to correctly build and deploy the Flask API from the `apps/backend` directory of the monorepo.

### Fixed
-   Resolved multiple Git submodule issues that prevented proper version tracking of the frontend and backend applications.
-   Corrected conflicting `package-lock.json` and `next.config.ts` files that caused local and production build failures.
-   Systematically debugged and resolved a series of Vercel 404 deployment errors by correcting build outputs and implementing explicit routing rules.

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-06-26 - Initial MVP and Data Foundation

This initial version represents the successful transition from a manual, spreadsheet-based system to a functional full-stack web application with a robust data foundation.

### Added
-   **Initial Backend API (v1):** Deployed a Python Flask application to Render, serving user data and job information via a RESTful API.
-   **Job Tracker Functionality:** Implemented full CRUD (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) endpoints for tracked jobs, allowing users to manage their application pipeline.
-   **Initial Frontend Dashboard (v1):** Developed a local Next.js application that successfully connects to the backend API to display user profiles, watchlists, job matches, and the interactive job tracker.
-   **Comprehensive Data Migration:**
    *   Successfully designed and executed a migration script to import all historical user and company data from **Bubble JSON exports** into the new PostgreSQL database.
    *   Successfully designed and executed a second, more complex migration script to parse, clean, and import all historical application data from multiple **CSV files** (`TT Opportunities`, `Greg Freed - Job Search`).
    *   Unified all disparate data sources into a single, relational database, creating a comprehensive foundation for all future features.

### Changed
-   **Upgraded Database:** Migrated from a conceptual file-based system to a production-grade **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Render.
-   **Enhanced Business Logic:** Refined API endpoints to filter out irrelevant job data and intelligently handle application status changes.

### Fixed
-   Resolved multiple Python dependency issues (`flask_cors`) to ensure stable deployment on Render.
-   Corrected and iteratively fixed database schema mismatches discovered during the complex data migration process.
