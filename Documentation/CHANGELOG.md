# Transparent Talent - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-06-27 - End-to-End User Authentication

This version implements a complete, secure authentication system across the entire application stack, from the frontend client to the backend API.

### Added
-   **User Authentication:** Integrated Clerk for robust user sign-up, sign-in, and session management across the full stack.
-   **Frontend Middleware:** Added `middleware.ts` to the Next.js app to protect all routes and enforce authentication.
-   **Backend Token Validation:** Created an `auth.py` decorator in the Flask backend to validate JWTs on all protected API endpoints.
-   **Clerk SDKs:** Added `@clerk/nextjs` to the frontend and `clerk-backend-api` to the backend.
-   **Database Migration:** Added a `clerk_user_id` column to the `users` table to link application data with the authentication provider.

### Changed
-   **API Security:** All backend endpoints in `app.py` were refactored to be protected by the `@token_required` decorator and to securely derive the user's identity from the session, removing user identifiers from URL parameters.
-   **Frontend Dashboard:** The main dashboard component was refactored to use modern, secure data-loading hooks (`useAuth`, `useUser`) instead of relying on URL parameters.
-   **Frontend Layout:** Modified `apps/frontend/app/layout.tsx` to include the `<ClerkProvider>` and user session controls (`<UserButton>`).

### Fixed
-   **Vercel Deployments:** Resolved a series of `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` and TypeScript build errors by correcting the Clerk middleware implementation and component props.
-   **Render Deployments:** Fixed numerous `ModuleNotFoundError` and `TypeError` crashes by correcting the Clerk python package name (`clerk-backend-api`), updating the import paths in `auth.py`, and aligning the Clerk client usage with the specific library version's requirements.
-   **Python Versioning:** Discovered and confirmed that the original Python version (3.13) was incompatible with the authentication libraries, necessitating a downgrade to a stable LTS version (3.12) for production deployments.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-06-26 - Monorepo Migration & Production Deployment

This version marks the successful re-architecting of the project into a professional monorepo structure and the full deployment of all services to production hosting environments.

### Added
-   **`vercel.json`:** Created a Vercel configuration file to provide explicit build and routing instructions, ensuring successful deployment of the frontend application.
-   **`ARCHITECTURE.md`:** Added a dedicated document to formally describe the full-stack system architecture.

### Changed
-   **Repository Structure:** Migrated the entire codebase from two separate projects into a single monorepo, managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo.
-   **Frontend Deployment:** The Next.js frontend is now deployed to **Vercel** from the `apps/frontend` directory of the monorepo.
-   **Backend Deployment:** The Render deployment configuration was updated to correctly build and deploy the Flask API from the `apps/backend` directory of the monorepo.

### Fixed
-   Resolved multiple Git submodule issues that prevented proper version tracking of the frontend and backend applications.
-   Corrected conflicting `package-lock.json` and `next.config.ts` files that caused local and production build failures.
-   Systematically debugged and resolved a series of Vercel 404 deployment errors by correcting build outputs and implementing explicit routing rules.

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-06-26 - Initial MVP and Data Foundation

This initial version represents the successful transition from a manual, spreadsheet-based system to a functional full-stack web application with a robust data foundation.

### Added
-   **Initial Backend API (v1):** Deployed a Python Flask application to Render, serving user data and job information via a RESTful API.
-   **Job Tracker Functionality:** Implemented full CRUD (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) endpoints for tracked jobs, allowing users to manage their application pipeline.
-   **Initial Frontend Dashboard (v1):** Developed a local Next.js application that successfully connects to the backend API to display user profiles, watchlists, job matches, and the interactive job tracker.
-   **Comprehensive Data Migration:**
    *   Successfully designed and executed a migration script to import all historical user and company data from **Bubble JSON exports** into the new PostgreSQL database.
    *   Successfully designed and executed a second, more complex migration script to parse, clean, and import all historical application data from multiple **CSV files** (`TT Opportunities`, `Greg Freed - Job Search`).
    *   Unified all disparate data sources into a single, relational database, creating a comprehensive foundation for all future features.

### Changed
-   **Upgraded Database:** Migrated from a conceptual file-based system to a production-grade **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Render.
-   **Enhanced Business Logic:** Refined API endpoints to filter out irrelevant job data and intelligently handle application status changes.

### Fixed
-   Resolved multiple Python dependency issues (`flask_cors`) to ensure stable deployment on Render.
-   Corrected and iteratively fixed database schema mismatches discovered during the complex data migration process.

-   **Clerk SDKs:** Added `@clerk/nextjs` to the frontend and `clerk-backend-api` to the backend.

### Changed
-   **API Security:** All backend endpoints in `app.py` are now protected by the `@token_required` decorator, requiring a valid user token for access.
-   **Frontend Layout:** Modified `apps/frontend/app/layout.tsx` to include the `<ClerkProvider>` and user session controls (`<UserButton>`).
-   **`turbo.json`:** Updated to use the `tasks` keyword instead of `pipeline` and to include environment variables in the build configuration.

### Fixed
-   **Vercel Deployments:** Resolved a series of `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` and TypeScript build errors by correcting the Clerk middleware implementation to align with library and Next.js version requirements.
-   **Render Deployments:** Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` and `TypeError` crashes by correcting the Clerk python package name (`clerk-backend-api`), updating the import path in `auth.py`, and aligning the Clerk client initialization with the current SDK.
-   **Python Versioning:** Discovered and noted that the original Python version (3.13) was incompatible with the authentication libraries, confirming the need for a stable LTS version for production deployments.
