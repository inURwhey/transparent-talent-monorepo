# Session Start

## Objective
Begin work on the next highest-priority feature from the product backlog. This session will involve code generation, debugging, and deployment across the full stack as needed.

## Context & Source Files
The following project documentation files are attached and should be used as the single source of truth for this session:
- `Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `Documentation/BACKLOG.md`
- `Documentation/BUSINESS_PLAN.md`
- `Documentation/CHANGELOG.md`
- `Documentation/PROTOCOLS.md`
- `Documentation/SYSTEM_BRIEF.md`

## My Task
1.  Review the attached documentation, paying close attention to the `BACKLOG.md` and `SYSTEM_BRIEF.md`.
2.  Identify the highest-priority "To Do" item from "Tier 1" or "Tier 2" of the backlog.
3.  Propose a plan of action to implement this feature and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## Style Notes for AI
-   The user is technically savvy and copies/pastes well.
-   Do not apologize for coding errors.
-   Do not compliment my competence.
