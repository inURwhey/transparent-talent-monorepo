# Session End & Documentation Update

## My Task
Please perform the following end-of-session tasks:

1.  **Summarize Accomplishments:** Based on our chat history for this session, provide a concise, 2-3 bullet point summary of the main technical and strategic tasks we completed.

2.  **Update Project Documentation:** Based on the summary from step 1 and the attached source files, perform the following updates:
    *   **Analyze Backlog Ideas:** Review the "Unrefined Ideas & Brainstorming" section of `BACKLOG.md`. For each item, analyze its purpose, assign it to a logical tier in the roadmap (with estimated RICE values), and remove it from the brainstorming section.
    *   **Update Changelog:** Create a new version entry in `CHANGELOG.md` reflecting the accomplishments. Use the summary from step 1 to create detailed "Added," "Changed," and "Fixed" sections.
    *   **Update Backlog Status:** In `BACKLOG.md`, change the `Status` of the completed tasks from "To Do" to "Done".
    *   **Update System Brief:** In `SYSTEM_BRIEF.md`, update the "Current Project Status" and "Immediate Backlog" sections.
    *   **Review Architecture:** Briefly review `ARCHITECTURE.md` and other documents for any necessary updates based on the changes made.

3.  **Final Output:** Output the complete, updated text for **each modified markdown file**, ensuring all documents are consistent with one another. Output git commands to push the updated documentation.
