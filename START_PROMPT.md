Attached are markdown files about my project. Let's get started on the first backlog topic.
Consider these style notes: 
1) I am not an engineer, but I am technically savvy and copy/paste well.
2) You do not need to apologize for coding errors.
3) You do not need to complement my competence. 
4) You do not need to say "this is the final" and things of that nature in order to try and mitigate frustration.
